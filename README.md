# test_animation

Test task focused on animation implementing given [design](https://dribbble.com/shots/6733935-Bright-App-UI-Kit).

In this example, I focused on animation, and tried to exactly as it is given in the design. 
I did not pay too much attention to state management and architectural side. If you want to check architecture and development part, offer to look to my mini [WeatherApp](https://github.com/kazbeksultanov/weather_app).
